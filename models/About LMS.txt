My android app is Lab management system shortly LMS. The main task of the app is to make a record of the lab items borrowed and returned by students. i haven't finished the app yet. but i have completed two modules borrowing the items and viewing the borrowed items. the input fields include student details, lab details , borrowed items names with quantity of items and images of the items. view items are fetched using the student id.I already have a ViewItemsActivity in which user should enter his student id. then student's name, email,course, phone, lab name, borrowal date, borrowed items with quantities in a recyclerview are shown. at the bottom of viewItems page there is a button called ReturnItems. when the button is clicked then the user navigates to ReturnItems screen where borrowed item names will be shown , next to the item names there will edittext to enter the quantity how many items the student is returning. below that there will be a button to take the picture of the item that is returning which is optional. below that, there is a return remarks field which is optional. finally submit button at the bottom. once clicked on the button the database will be updated and returns back to viewitems page. viewitems page will also be updated with the latest changes. now i'm left with the viewallitems page where i have to show all the items of all the student who borrowed. i have used mvvm, corotines, hilt while doing this app. so please guide me further to complete viewallitems screen
